## EC-Microsoft-Teams

This plugin integrates CloudBees Flow with Microsoft Teams.

### Pre-requisites:

1. Create an Incoming Webhook for the channel
For each channel you want to integrate CloudBees Flow, you need to create an [Incoming Webhook](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/webhooks-and-connectors/what-are-webhooks-and-connectors) in Microsoft Teams.
You can follow this procedure: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/webhooks-and-connectors/how-to/add-incoming-webhook.
Once you have created an Incoming Webhook for your channel, you will get a URL generated. This URL will be used as a parameter for the Microsoft Teams plugin in CloudBees Flow.

2. Install the plugin on your Flow instance.

3. Create a _blank_ configuration on your Flow instance (just provide a name to the configuration).

4. Use in your Pipeline the procedure `sendMessage` provided by the plugin. This procedure requires 2 parameters:
* Incoming Webhook URL: use the one generated by Teams in step 1.
* a Message. You can use Markdown formatting in this message and unicode values for emojis (example: & # x 1 F 6 3 8 ; [remove spaces between chars])

### FAQ
* I can't create an Incoming Webhook on my Free plan on Microsoft Teams (`More Options` menu does nto appear), what can I do ?
  * You can go to Apps (left menu), search in the category `Connectors`, install the Incoming Webhook app and create a new Incoming Webhook (choose the channel and give a name).
